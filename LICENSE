The content based on the "3D Graphics with OpenGL Basic Theory" article by 
Chua Hock-Chuan of the Nanyang Technology University of Singapore at 
https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/opengl/CG_BasicsTheory.html. 
The content is a heavily simplified version of his article in order to make 
it approachable for new graphics programmers. Thanks to Chua Hock-Chuan for 
providing this content.

I would be promoting Chua Hock-Chuan's programming notes at 
https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/index.html if you are interested.
